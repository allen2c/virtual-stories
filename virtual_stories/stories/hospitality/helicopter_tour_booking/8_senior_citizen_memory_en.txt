That's very reassuring. Could you tell me more about the boarding process? We want to make sure we can manage it comfortably.

Of course! We have a specialized boarding process for our senior guests. Our helipad elevator takes you directly to the boarding area, where our trained staff will assist with any mobility needs. The helicopter has step stools and handrails, and we can provide extra time for comfortable boarding. Our pilots are experienced with senior passengers and maintain very gentle flight patterns.

That sounds manageable. My husband has a hearing aid. Will there be any issues with noise during the flight?

The guest is asking about noise levels for hearing aids. This is information about our helicopter equipment that I can answer directly.

That's a great question! Our helicopters are equipped with noise-reduction headsets that are hearing aid compatible. The headsets provide clear audio communication with the pilot and have adjustable volume controls. We can also provide written information cards about the flight path if needed. Everything is designed for senior comfort and accessibility.

Wonderful! This has put our minds at ease. Speaking of comfort, I noticed you have a medical concierge service.

Yes, we have a full medical concierge service available 24/7. Our medical team can assist with medication management, coordinate with your healthcare providers, or be on standby during your tour. Would you like me to have our medical concierge contact you to discuss any specific needs?

That would be helpful. Could you have them call us tomorrow morning? We'd like to discuss a few health considerations.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants the medical concierge to contact them. This is a standard service request that I can arrange directly without specific tools.
