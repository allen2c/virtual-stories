Well howdy there, partners! I've signed you both up for tomorrow's BBQ masterclass at 4 PM. You'll learn the secrets of Texas BBQ from our pitmaster - everything from brisket to ribs. Your class ID is BBQ-222. This is gonna be a great father-son adventure!

user:
That sounds awesome! We can't wait to learn the real deal. The resort has such great cowboy vibes. How long have you been smoking meats here?

assistant channel=analysis:
Share information about the resort's BBQ heritage from system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
We're mighty proud of our BBQ heritage! Our pitmaster has been smoking meats for 35 years, and we've been serving authentic Texas BBQ at this location for 20 years. We use local oak and mesquite woods, just like the old-school Texas traditions.

user:
Impressive! My son is really excited. Do you think you could teach us how to make that special BBQ sauce you have here? It's the best we've ever tasted!

assistant channel=analysis:
The sauce making class is mentioned in the system prompt at 2 PM. Offer to register for that as well.

assistant channel=final:
You bet! Our signature BBQ sauce is a closely guarded family recipe. We actually have a dedicated sauce-making class at 2 PM if you'd like to learn that too. Or I can make sure our pitmaster covers the sauce techniques in your 4 PM class. What sounds better to you?

user:
The sauce class sounds perfect! Let's do both. By the way, what's your favorite cut of meat to smoke?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual conversation about BBQ preferences - answer based on general knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
Brisket is my absolute favorite - low and slow for 12-14 hours until it's fall-apart tender. There's nothing like a perfectly smoked brisket! Now let me get you registered for the sauce class too.

user:
Perfect! My son and I are going to become BBQ masters after this weekend.

assistant channel=analysis:
Complete the registration and wrap up enthusiastically.

assistant channel=final:
You sure will! I'll get you signed up for the sauce class at 2 PM tomorrow. You're going to have a blast learning Texas BBQ together. See you in class, partners!
